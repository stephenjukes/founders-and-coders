    <h2>I never thought I'd have the remotest interest in computers or programming ...</h2>

    <section id="mastermind">
      <p>... It was all so alien, and certainly not of my world. I suppose my journey here started back in 2011. A friend and I were talking about mastermind, the old board game where you have to crack your opponent’s code, only using feedback in the form of black and white pegs. We didn’t have a board, so we decided to improvise by colouring cells in Excel.

    <section id="excelGames">
      <p>That same night, I thought about the possibilities not of two humans playing on a computer, but of one human playing against the computer. I stayed up all night and made a mastermind game in Excel that would provide feedback to a human attempting to crack a randomly generated code. I was so excited by this accomplishment that I spent the next few years of my free time using simple database functions to make Excel games.

    <section id="forLoop">
      <p>Some time later, I was asked to sit in on a school IT lesson in basic Javascript, and in my capacity as Director of Studies, provide the teacher with suggestions on how to make the course more comprehensive to the students. What I never expected was to fall in love with programming. I can’t really explain why I thought it was so cool to list the contents of an array with simple indexing and a ‘for’ loop, but this was ultimately what convinced me that I wanted a career in code.

    <section id="workStudy">
      <p>For the next few years, I balanced a full time job during the day and two children in the evening with self study in coding during the night. Most nights, I would study from the Odin Project and practice code from 8pm to 1 or 2am, before getting up at 5am the same morning for work. Even after 3 hours of sleep, I would wake up excited about the progress I had made, or with a possible solution to a bug that had stumped me the previous night.

    <section id="foundersCoders">
      <p> Though I have managed to throw code together to make some things work, I feel that I now need guidance on how to make my code great. I really hope that Founders and Coders can provide me with this huge privilege. In return, I hope to use all that I learn to assist Founders and Coders with future aspiring developers who hope to achieve the same goals as me.
